= Git Editor

An editor for Git in Windows

== Install

(If you are not using ruby, please refer to the standalone version)
To install the gem:
  
  gem install git_editor
  
Make sure that you already have Git installed on your machine.
After the installation of the gem, run the following command in the command line

  git_editor install
  
Git_editor is now the default editor of Git.

== Standalone version

If you are not using ruby, you can download the git_editor-0.1.0.zip from the repository. Unzip it to a location of your choice. 
Make sure that you have Git installed on your machine. And run

  git config --global core.editor "<path of your editor>\giteditor.exe"
  
for example:

  git config --global core.editor "C:\Program files\git_editor\giteditor.exe"

Then Git will use this editor as its default editor.

== Usage

After installation, the editor will automatically show up during config editing, interactive rebasing and commiting.

The syntax is colored so that you can see clearly which lines are the comment lines and which are actual commit messages.

You can run 
  git config --global --edit 
to ensure that the editor is working properly.

The editor supports multi-selection. just press alt+shift+up/down arrow. It will keep multiple lines selected so you can type on multiple lines simultaneously. This is particular useful when you are working on interactive rebasing and you want to replace a bunch of "pick" by "squash".

When you press Ctrl+S, the editor save and quit automatically.

Easy access to theme customization will be in future releases.

well as an editor for Git.
